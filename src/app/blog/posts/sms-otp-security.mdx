## You know OTPs, yeah?

Imagine you're the gatekeeper of your online castle, and your password is the secret handshake. You set a password like "ILovePizza123," and you're in! But here's where it gets interesting - hackers are like the stand-up comedians of the internet. They can guess your password faster than you can say "extra cheese."

Now, think of OTP as your trusty online sidekick. It's a code that changes every time you use it - no matter how hard those hackers try, they can't predict what OTP you'll get next. A 6-digit PIN can generate a million codes, so trying to guess it is virtually impossible!

## The Issue: SIM Swapping

In 2020, a news story emerged illustrating how seemingly minor actions can result in significant harm. Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, had his account compromised, and the cause was a SIM swap.

> Sim swapping is when someone tricks your phone company into giving them control of your phone number, which they can use to access your messages and accounts.

Besides SIM swapping, there are several reasons why using OTPs via SMS is not a good practice:

- **Phishing Attacks**: SMS-based OTPs can be susceptible to phishing attacks. Cybercriminals may send convincing messages asking you to provide the OTP you received.
- **Lack of End-to-End Encryption**: SMS messages are not encrypted from end to end. This means SMS-based OTPs are transmitted in plaintext.
- **Dependence on Mobile Network**: If your mobile network experiences an outage, you won't receive SMS-based OTPs.

## The Options: Convenience vs. Security

**Mobile Authenticator Apps**: Authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy generate time-based OTPs directly on your mobile device without needing an internet connection. They are more secure than SMS OTPs because they aren't vulnerable to SIM swapping or interception.

**Hardware Security Keys**: Hardware security keys, such as YubiKey or Google Titan, provide a highly secure way to authenticate. They are considered one of the most secure methods of multi-factor authentication.

**Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint or facial recognition are becoming more common for securing devices and accounts.

## The Best Fit

The most convenient and secure option is **mobile authenticator apps**:

- **Convenience**: Easy to set up and use. Just scan a QR code during initial setup.
- **Security**: OTPs are generated locally on your device and don't rely on a network connection.

## Conclusion

If you're using a reputable website, it should offer the option to use an authenticator app instead of relying on SMS. When you set up the authenticator app, they often provide backup codes - store these safely!

Oh, and one last thing: it's time to bid farewell to SMS OTPs!
