## So what is private browsing?

"Private browsing is a technique designed to safeguard your online anonymity. It ensures that when you close your web browser, only you are aware of your online activities."

That's the expectation, but the internet and computers are intricate, providing only a certain "level" of privacy. The true essence of private browsing can be defined as:

> Private browsing is a method of internet use that minimizes traces of your online activity, making it less accessible to those around you.

## Beyond your browser

When you visit a website, it might seem like you instantly find what you're looking for, and that's it. However, behind the scenes, that website could be relying on more electronic devices than you have, and it might be coming to you from a place as far away as a 15-hour flight, all happening in just seconds.

Those lightning-fast electronic devices (servers and other machines) operate in harmony, much like teamwork. However, the key distinction lies in these electronic devices meticulously documenting their actions and everything they provide you with. This recorded information serves various purposes, like showing you specific ads, controlling access to websites, tracking security, and providing content tailored to different regions.

## Am I Vulnerable?

Not necessarily, as long as you exercise caution. To achieve that, it's crucial to understand what precautions to take:

- **Your Computer**: It faithfully adheres to its promise, swiftly forgetting your online activities as soon as you close the private window.
- **Internet Service Provider**: The ISP needs to know which website you're seeking and your general location. There's no way to avoid disclosing this to your ISP (unless there is, but we'll explore VPNs).
- **HTTPS**: Encryption means your computer and the website server communicate in a secret language that only they understand, rendering it gibberish to any other devices in between.

## Simple Tips for Mindful Web Surfing

### The HTTPS 🔒

When you see "HTTPS" at the beginning of a website's address, it signifies that your content will be shielded with encryption, making it decipherable only by the intended website.

### The VPN

A VPN operates akin to a dependable friend who assists you in accomplishing tasks discreetly. When you use a VPN, the situation undergoes a transformation - adding an extra layer of anonymity, along with the benefit of changing your virtual location.

## Conclusion

By using secure websites with HTTPS and a VPN, your private browsing experience becomes more robust. While a VPN is recommended for enhanced security, it may not always be necessary, but it does have its place in maintaining online privacy.
