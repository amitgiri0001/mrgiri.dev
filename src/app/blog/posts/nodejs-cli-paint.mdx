## About

NodeJs CLI Paint is a terminal-based drawing application that brings paint-like features to your command line. Built with TypeScript, it provides an interactive way to create and manipulate drawings right in your terminal.

## Features

### Create Canvas
Enter the height and width of the canvas to create a virtual canvas. The canvas is rendered using ASCII characters, giving you a visual representation of your drawing area.

### Drawing Options

After creating a canvas, you have several options to play around with:

- **Line**: With the given coordinates of `x1`, `y1` as starting point and `x2`, `y2` as end, the line will be plotted inside the canvas accordingly.
  
- **Rectangle**: Similar to line coordinates, the rectangle will be plotted from top left corner (`x1`, `y1`) to bottom right corner (`x2`, `y2`).

- **Color Fill**: Choose a character to paint with. The `x1` and `y1` coordinates decide which section will be painted. The behavior is similar to any other painting application - it respects the borders and does not overflow the color.

### Seamless Navigation
You can re-create a new canvas or quit seamlessly at any point during the session.
