## Overview

This project demonstrates the evolution of a voice agent system, progressing from simple implementations to a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system. The latest version is a complete AI news podcast producer that:

- 🔍 Researches the latest AI news for NASDAQ-listed US companies
- 📊 Enriches news with real-time financial context (stock prices, market changes)
- 📝 Compiles structured research reports in Markdown format
- 🎙️ Generates multi-speaker podcast audio using Google's Gemini TTS
- ✅ Enforces data quality through source whitelisting and freshness filters

## Features

### Intelligent News Research
- Searches for AI news specifically about NASDAQ-listed companies
- Filters sources through a whitelist (TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Verge, etc.)
- Enforces data freshness (last week's news)

### Financial Context Enrichment
- Automatically extracts company tickers from news
- Fetches real-time stock prices and market changes using `yfinance`
- Gracefully handles missing data without halting the process

### Multi-Speaker Podcast Generation
- Converts research reports into conversational podcast scripts
- Features two hosts: 'Joe' (enthusiastic) and 'Jane' (analytical)
- Generates high-quality audio using Gemini's multi-speaker TTS
- Saves output as WAV files

## Agent Workflow

1. **Acknowledgment**: Agent confirms the task
2. **Search**: Finds relevant AI news from whitelisted sources
3. **Extract**: Identifies companies and stock tickers
4. **Enrich**: Fetches financial data for identified tickers
5. **Structure**: Organizes data using `AINewsReport` schema
6. **Save**: Writes formatted Markdown report
7. **Script**: Creates conversational podcast script
8. **Generate**: Produces multi-speaker audio file
9. **Confirm**: Reports completion to user

## Tech Stack

- **Google ADK** (Agent Development Kit) >= 1.15.0
- **yfinance** for financial data retrieval
- **Pydantic** for data validation and modeling
- **uv** for fast Python package management

## Setup
